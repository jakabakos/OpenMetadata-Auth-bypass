# Authentication bypass with path parameter in OpenMetadata (CVE-2024-28255) - exploit script

## Introduction

OpenMetadata is an advanced platform designed to unify data discovery, observability, and governance. It leverages a central metadata repository to provide in-depth data lineage, facilitate seamless team collaboration, and ensure robust governance across an organizationâ€™s data ecosystem.

The vulnerability (CVE-2024-28255) lies in the JwtFilter, which handles API authentication by verifying JWT tokens. An attacker can exploit this by inserting arbitrary strings into path parameters, bypassing JWT validation, and gaining unauthorized access to any endpoint, including those leading to potential SpEL expression injection. This bypass can lead to severe security breaches, compromising the integrity and confidentiality of the system.
